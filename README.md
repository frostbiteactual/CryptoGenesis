# CryptoGenesis


 CryptoGenesis was designed to generate ambiguous project names based off of the cryptonym format of major US Government agencies. However I have begun adapting this for other means. This can aid the user in generating their own diagraphs randomly for their own definitions. 
 
 Most notable 3 letter agencies typically use a two word sequence when fielding code names or code words when referring to projects, operations, persons, agencies, etc. 
 
 
***Roadmap***
-  Add functionality for a more expansive terminal ui. 
- Add GUI option
- Add the ability to generate different forms of cryptonyms from databases. (For example: prefixes, single words, etc. to add more variability)
- Add more databases (Animals, Colors, etc.)
- Add the ability for user to format cryptonyms upon generation. (For example: userprefix//cryptonym)
